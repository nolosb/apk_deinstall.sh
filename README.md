# apk_deinstall.sh
A bash script to deinstall unwanted apps from an android installation. Requires adb. Loops through an array of apk names and prompts whether the package could be found and if so, deinstalls it as either regular or system app.

The packages in the script are what I deinstalled from a Xiaomi Miui 11 installation.
